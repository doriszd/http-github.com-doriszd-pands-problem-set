#Numbers that are divisible by 6, but not 12 in range from 1000 to 10000
for num in range (1000, 10001):
    # If number divided by 6 equals 0
    if num % 6 == 0:
        # If number divided by 12 does not equal 0
        if not num % 12 == 0: 
            # Print all the numbers that are divisible by 6, but not 12
            print (num)
