5. Write a program that asks the user to input a positive integer and tells the user whether or not the number is a prime. 


User is asked to insert a positive number. 
If the number that the user entered is greater than 1 then the program checks all the numbers in range between 2 and entered number. 
If after dividing entered number with each of the numbers in range up to that number there are no divisors left than the program prints "This is not 
a prime number". In other cases the program prints "n  is a prime number".

If the entered number is equal or less than 1 the program prints "n is a prime number".
