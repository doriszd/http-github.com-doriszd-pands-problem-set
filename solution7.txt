7. Write a program that takes a positive floating point number as input and
outputs an approximation of the square root. 

User is asked to enter a positive number. 

The initial estimate is 6. 
Algorithm of Newton's method is used in " while " loop. 
While the estimate * estimate - roofof is greater than 0.1 Newton's method of
calculating square roots is used:

estimate -=((estimate * estimate )-rootof) / (2 * estimate)

Program prints the square root of entered number.
