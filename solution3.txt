 Write a program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not 12. 

The program prints all numbers between 1000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not 12. 
If a number in the range is divisible by 6 with remainder 0 and if the same number is not
divisible by 12 than the program prints that number. The program goes through all numbers in the range mentioned above.
