8. Write a program that outputs today’s date in format “Monday, January 10th
2019 at 1:15pm. 

There are several datetime objects imported from Python’s standard library which
show current date and time. 
Now – shows days of the week
month – shows current month
day – dates in a month
In order to print English ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd..) for loop is being
used. If statements are used to execute ordinal numbers that take ending “st”, “nd”, “rd”. 
In other cases ending “th” is printed. 
year – shows the year we are in.
Time – current time printed in format hours, minutes (0 before the number is
excluded)
Current date and time is printed in format: day (day of the week), month,
day(date), year, time. 
End=” “ is used when printing strings in order to have all the objects printed
in a line.
