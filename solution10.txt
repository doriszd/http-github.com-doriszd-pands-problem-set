10. Write a program that displays a plot of the functions x, x2, 2x in the range [o, 4] 



In order to write this program I had to import numpy and matplotlib libraries. To get the range from 0 to 4 I had to include numbers from 0 to 5. 0 displays beginning value of the range while 5 displays end value. There are 3 lines, x is red, x2 is blue and 2x is green. There is a legend in upper left corner to make plot more apprehensible to users.
