1. Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the sum of all numbers between one and that number.


This program sums all numbers between 1 and the chosen number.
"x" signifies the chosen number
"a" refers to the range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number
"b" is sum of all numbers between 1 and chosen number
If a user decides to enter negative number, a message to enter integer greater than 0 will be displayed to encourage them to try again.
